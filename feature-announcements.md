# ‚úÖ üìÇ Developer Documentation ‚Äî `feature/announcement` Urgency Indicator & UI Enhancements

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Name

`feature/announcement` ‚Äî Adds a visual **Urgency Indicator**, cleans up static placeholder sections, and improves the announcement system‚Äôs UI/UX to match the **Figma** design.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Objective

- Highlight **urgent announcements** with a clear **red pulse animation** for high visibility.
- Pass the `isUrgent` flag through all relevant components so urgency status is always available for conditional rendering.
- Enhance the **Announcement Details Modal** with urgency badge, creator info, and better role-based editing access.
- Fix confusing modal behaviors:
  - Prevent **form fields** from keeping old edit data when creating new announcements.
  - Keep the **Announcement Details dialog open** or closed at the right moments when switching between **view** and **edit**.
- Keep static or placeholder sections commented (not removed) for future reuse.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Tech Stack

- **React.js** (components)
- **Next.js** (routing)
- **TypeScript** (type safety)
- **Tailwind CSS** (responsive styling)
- **React Icons** & custom SVGs

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Improvements

- ‚úÖ **Urgency Indicator:**  
  - Adds a small red pulse or icon next to urgent announcements to make them stand out.
- ‚úÖ **Prop Flow:**  
  - `isUrgent` passed through `Announcement` ‚Üí `AnnouncementCard` ‚Üí `AnnouncementDetails`.
- ‚úÖ **Details Modal:**  
  - Shows creator details (name, avatar).
  - Displays urgency badge if relevant.
  - Includes close button and edit controls based on user‚Äôs role.
- ‚úÖ **Static Content:**  
  - Comments, view counts, attachment blocks commented but not removed.
- ‚úÖ **Better Edit/Create Logic:**  
  - Reset form state when creating a **new announcement**, so no leftover fields from last edit.
  - Handled modal logic so that **Announcement Details** only closes when needed and doesn‚Äôt auto-toggle unexpectedly when switching between **view** and **edit** modes.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Problems & How They Were Tackled

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No urgency styling | Designed red pulse animation & conditionally rendered it with `isUrgent` |
| Static view/comment counters cluttering layout | Commented instead of deleting for safe reuse |
| Creator info missing | Added `creator` details in modal |
| Attachments block confusing | Commented out to be re-enabled later |
| Comments form didn‚Äôt submit correctly | Switched to real `<form>` with `onSubmit` |
| Reply icon missing | Added new `reply` icon for replies |
| **Create/Edit modal reused stale form data** | Reset form state when switching to `Create` so old data clears |
| **Detail dialog closed/reopened at wrong times** | Improved modal logic: when **Edit** is clicked, the **Details** stays closed until the user finishes editing ‚Äî avoids flicker |

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Final Outcome
